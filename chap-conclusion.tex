\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This is the conclusion.

Prompt search retains some sensitivity 
for long (short) gluino (DM) lifetimes (and is the most sensitive sub-cm and 
lifetimes beyond the detector, hence continue with prompt search in future), 
although clearly could be improved with a dedicated search/tagger as shown by 
the b-tag effects.

\begin{comment}
Mention improvements using ML tagger for all displacements (extending the 
b-tagging algorithm) and list of things to take advantage in OB DM LL page 7.
see Rob_EXO_LL_tagger.
exploit jet id variables (eg chf etc), use ML/DL
