Fancy introduction to particle physics, DM, SUSY, LLPs.

Dark matter is a hypothetical form of matter which constitutes about 27\% of 
the total energy content of the universe [1]. Its nature is unknown and its 
presence has so far only been inferred indirectly through its gravitational 
effects. Large efforts by the astrophysical and particle physics communities 
are 
being made on searches for the elusive dark matter.

Mention previous results somewhere (haven't found SUSY/DM/BSM/anything new 
since Higgs boson).

Chapter 2 will describe 
the theoretical foundations and motivations for this search. Chapter 3 will do 
bla, etc.
